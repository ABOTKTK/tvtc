ECE 151: OSPF on point-to-point networks simulation in Python

Assumptions/Conventions/Clarifications/Limitations:

Area type: Backbone Area/Area 0.0.0.0/Area 0
* All routers are in Area 0. Thus, all routes are intra-area routes.


Router type
* Since the routers are all in Area 0, all routers are backbone routers


Router IDs
* The Router ID (RID) used is simply the hostname of a router instead of the
  IP address of a router's interface


LSA Type
* All transmitted and received LSAs are Router LSAs


Link type: Point-to-Point
* All routers are connected via point-to-point links
* Physical connections between routers are specified in the configuration files.
* DR and BDR for each segment need not be elected since the network type is point-to-point
* Hello and Dead intervals are 10 seconds and 40 seconds, respectively


Path cost
* use Cisco's "standard" metric which is solely based on a link's bandwidth
* cost = 10^8 bps / bandwidth (in bps)
* specified bandwidth for each interface is for the uplink (outgoing direction)
