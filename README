ECE 151: Intra-domain routing simulation (OSPF v2 routing protocol) using Python

Assumptions/Conditions/Limitations:

Area type
* backbone area (area 0.0.0.0/area 0)
* All routers are in Area 0. Thus, all routes are intra-area routes.


Network type
* point-to-point - All routers are connected via point-to-point (serial) links


DR and BDR election
* DR and BDR need not be elected since the network type is point-to-point


Path cost
* use Cisco's "standard" metric which is solely based on a link's bandwidth
* cost = 10^8 bps / bandwidth (in bps)


Router types
* Since the routers are all in Area 0, all routers are backbone routers


Network Topology
* Physical connections (serial links) between routers are specified in the configuration files.
